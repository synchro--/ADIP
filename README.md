# ADIP
This is a project about digital image processing, with particular regard to image segmentation. 

The goals are: 
<ul>
<li>Implement an efficient approach to estimate the oriented gradient of histograms. </li>
<li>Utilize the local minimum of the latter as a seed for a morphological watershed segmentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

We succesfully managed to achieve both tasks. See "Final Report" to get an intro to the topics of this research and the presentation of our work and the idea behind the actual implementation of the algorithm, following the Arbelaez paper. Input images can be found in the input folder and the corresponding results in the output one. 


Soon more documentation will be added.
