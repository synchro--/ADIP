# Advanced Digital Image Processing - Project Work
This is a project about digital image processing, with particular regard to image segmentation. 

The goals are: 
<ul>
<li>Implement an efficient approach to estimate the oriented gradient of histograms. </li>
<li>Utilize the local minimum of the latter as a seed for a morphological watershed segmentation</li>
</ul>

### Results

We successfully managed to achieve both tasks. See "Final Report" to get an intro to the topics of this research and the presentation of our work. 
The idea behind the actual implementation of the algorithm is based on the paper from Arbelaez. The former is in the docs folder together with some other useful document and our presentations. 

Soon more documentation will be added.
