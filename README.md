# ADIP
This is a project about digital image processing, with particular regard to image segmentation. 

The goals are: 
<ul>
<li>Implement an efficient approach to estimate the oriented gradient of histograms. </li>
<li>Utilize the local minimum of the latter as a seed for a morphological watershed segmentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

We succesfully managed to achieve both tasks. Soon a report will be added to the repo with an intro to the topics and the actual ideas behind our solution.
